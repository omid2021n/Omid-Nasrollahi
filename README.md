# UVM  D-flipflop
Behavior of a D-Flip-Flop:
A D-flip-flop is a sequential logic element that captures the value of its input (din) at the rising edge of the clock and propagates it to the output (dout) after one clock cycle. The behavior can be summarized as:

At the rising edge of the clock:

If rst is high, dout is reset to 0.

If rst is low, dout takes the value of din.
